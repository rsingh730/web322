                <p>
                    My journey into programming started with a curiosity about how websites and applications work. Over time, this curiosity turned into a passion for creating solutions that make everyday tasks easier and more efficient. I love to solve challenges, experiment with new technologies, and continuously learn and grow.

                    I’m particularly interested in backend development and enjoy working with databases, APIs, and server-side logic. I also love working on full-stack applications and making the user interface as smooth and intuitive as possible. Whether it's creating web apps or exploring new frameworks, I thrive on the excitement of learning new things.

                <p>
                    In the future, I aim to work on impactful projects that help people connect through technology, improve accessibility, and streamline processes. I am excited about the potential of technology to change the world, and I want to be a part of that journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I’m learning more about Node.js, Express, and database management, as well as keeping up with the latest web development trends. My goal is to become a well-rounded developer who can build robust and scalable applications while maintaining high performance and security.
